# Heart catheter example
#
# A study was conducted and data collected to fit a regression model to predict 
# the length of a catheter needed to pass from a major artery at the femoral 
# region and moved into the heart for children (Weisberg 1980). For 12 children, 
# the proper catheter length was determined by checking with a fluoroscope that 
# the catheter tip had reached the right position. The goal is to determine a 
# model where a childâ€™s height and weight could be used to predict the proper 
# catheter length.
